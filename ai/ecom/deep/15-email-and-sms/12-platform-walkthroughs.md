Clavio setup: the email tool for visitors who start checkout but do not buy [L1131, 2018+].

#### SMS Bump with Clavio

- Set up Clavio and SMS Bump in parallel to recover abandoned carts. SMS Bump only sends to customers who have agreed to receive SMS [L1347, undated].
- Checkout setting for abandoned cart recovery: remove phone number as an optional checkout field and make email a required field, so every customer can be retargeted by email [L1347, undated].
- Recovering paid-traffic add-to-cart visitors who did not buy:
  1. Confirm that the Clavio retargeting emails and SMS Bump messages are set up correctly [L1347, undated].
  2. If results are weak, change the email copy and the copywriting [L1347, undated].
  3. Change the discount or the offer in the retargeting emails [L1347, undated].

#### Review of an Existing Sequence

- Review the abandoned cart sequence against the templates provided, and update it where it does not match the new approach [L0493, 2021-22].

### Tracking and Mistakes

#### Tracking and Go-Live Checks

- one source: for each email, set Smart sending to off, UTM tracking to on, and switch from Draft to Live [L0476, undated; L0634, undated; L1297, 2023].
- one source: set every email in the sequence to Live after cloning [L0573, undated; L0607, undated].
- Shopify Admin: click Apply Changes and confirm to make the changes effective immediately [L0266, 2020-26; L0282, 2020-26].
- Shopify status check: confirm the button shows 'Turn off workflow' to verify the automation is active [L0149, undated; L0282, 2020-26].
- Shopify Messaging: the automation now runs indefinitely once active [L0149, undated].
- Check each timer before going live [L0476, undated].

#### Mistakes to Avoid

- Leaving the default timers in place for welcome and abandoned cart flows means messages arrive too late or too late for the offer. Check each timer before going live [L0476, undated].
- Customizing the Shopify template without a specific improvement adds risk, because the pre-built template is built on performance data [L0282, 2020-26].
- Offering a discount in the first message is the most common mistake; start with a plain reminder and a checkout link [L1449, 2021-22].
- Stopping all emails after the abandoned-cart flow ends is a common error. Contacts who did not buy should move into the 30-day prospect master flow rather than being dropped, because they may still be in the market [L1449, 2021-22].
- Do not word reminders as if the customer forgot something, because that implies the item was not valuable to them [L1208, 2025-26].
- Do not restart the shopping journey in the early abandoned-cart messages by suggesting other products or new options. Doing so confuses a buyer who was ready to complete the purchase [L1208, 2025-26].
- Do not add extra calls to action (social media icons, app download prompts or other links) to the first three abandoned-cart emails [L1208, 2025-26].
- Do not add a second headline or sub-headline to the first email unless a split test proves it helps [L0567, 2025-26].
- Do not send a last-chance email with a deadline that conflicts with the countdown or the code expiry time; keep the P.S. line consistent with both [L0567, 2025-26].
- Do not keep a 4-hour first interval as a fixed rule for all emails; the one source guidance avoids arbitrary 4-hour intervals that hit customers at inconvenient times [L0261, 2025-26].
- Do not treat the abandoned cart flow as a one-off reminder; it is a series [L0572, 2014].
- Do not leave an automation running with an expired discount; the discount should expire only after the final email, with email 4 sent a few hours before that expiry [L0606, undated].
- Do not send SMS to customers who did not opt in; SMS cannot recover their carts [L1347, undated].
- Do not use the abandoned-cart sequence to deliver top-of-funnel content or broad brand introductions [L1208, 2025-26].

### Scope and Standard

- Use an abandoned checkout flow with more than one email, not a single reminder. A typical flow runs five to seven emails spread across five to seven days [L1522, 2021-22].
- If a store already runs an abandoned-cart flow, review it against the standard sequence: reminders, a personal owner email, a time-limited discount and a final reminder. Add only the missing emails rather than rebuilding the whole flow [L1449, 2021-22].
- All advice in this section is older advice from one source's 2021-22 course [L1449, 2021-22; L1522, 2021-22].

### Why Emails Are Spaced

- Abandoned-cart emails are spaced with waiting periods because many people do not check email right away [L1449, 2021-22].
- Each step gives the shopper time to act before the next message is sent [L1449, 2021-22].

### Sequence Timeline

The following schedule is derived from the moment of abandonment [L1449, 2021-22]:

1. 0 hours: first reminder with product and checkout link [L1449, 2021-22].
2. 6 hours: second reminder of the same type [L1449, 2021-22].
3. 24 hours: personal owner email asking whether you can help and inviting a reply [L1449, 2021-22].
4. 48 hours: time-limited discount offer for 3 days [L1449, 2021-22].
5. 96 hours: either a helpful content email (broad product range) or a discount reminder with 24 hours left (narrow product range) [L1449, 2021-22].
6. 120 hours: final discount reminder with about 4 hours left [L1449, 2021-22].
7. After the final reminder, move the contact to the 30-day prospect master flow [L1449, 2021-22].

### Per-Email Jobs

**Reminders (0 hours and 6 hours).** Both use the same plain text. Neither includes a discount [L1449, 2021-22].

```
Subject: You left {product_name} in your cart

Hi {first_name},

Your {product_name} is still in your cart and ready to order. You can finish your purchase here:
{checkout_link}

{business_name}

(Send the same email again 6 hours after the first one, using the same text. Do not include a discount in either reminder.)
```
[L1449, 2021-22]

**Personal owner email (24 hours).** Write it as a welcome-style email from the business owner, 18 hours after the second reminder, to a shopper who has not purchased [L1449, 2021-22]. Use the following prompt text unchanged:

```
Write a personal welcome-style email from the business owner for an abandoned cart, 18 hours after the second reminder, to a shopper who has not purchased. Keep it short and written by a real person. Share a brief part of your story and what sets your business apart, and do not mention the abandoned product. End with one clear call to action: ask whether there is anything you can help with and ask the shopper to simply reply to this email. Use a plain-text style, no discount, no pressure.
```
[L1449, 2021-22]

**Discount offer (48 hours).** Send the time-limited discount with the product, the code and the checkout link. The offer lasts 3 days and ends on the expiry date [L1449, 2021-22]. Use the following template unchanged:

```
Subject: {first_name}, your discount for {product_name} is ready

Hi {first_name},

You left {product_name} in your cart. We have set up a discount code for you: {discount_code}

Use the code at checkout here:
{checkout_link}

This offer is time limited and ends in 3 days, on {expiry_date}. After that the code will no longer work.

{business_name}
```
[L1449, 2021-22]

**Narrow-range discount reminder (96 hours, 24 hours left).** Use this email when the store has a narrow product range [L1449, 2021-22]. Use the following prompt text unchanged:

```
Write a discount-reminder email for an abandoned cart, sent 24 hours after the discount offer when the store has a narrow product range. Include the product, a link back to checkout and the discount code, and state that 24 hours are left to finish the purchase. Keep it short and direct.
```
[L1449, 2021-22]

**Broad-range content email (96 hours).** Use this email when the store has a broad product range, in place of the discount reminder [L1449, 2021-22].

**Final reminder (120 hours, about 4 hours left).** Send a brief, factual final reminder [L1449, 2021-22]. Use the following prompt text unchanged:

```
Write a final abandoned-cart reminder email, sent 4 hours before a discount expires. Include the product, a direct link back to checkout, the discount code, and a short, clear statement that the discount is about to expire in 4 hours. Keep it brief and factual, with no extra offers.
```
[L1449, 2021-22]

### Discount Timing

- The discount is offered at 48 hours and runs for 3 days [L1449, 2021-22].
- The first two reminders contain no discount [L1449, 2021-22].
- The narrow-range reminder is sent at 96 hours, when 24 hours are left [L1449, 2021-22].
- The final reminder is sent at 120 hours, with about 4 hours left [L1449, 2021-22].
- The source values do not fully align, so check them before building:
  - The 96-hour send matches the "24 hours left" wording, since the discount ends at 120 hours [L1449, 2021-22].
  - The wording "sent 24 hours after the discount offer" does not match the 96-hour timing. The offer is at 48 hours, so 24 hours after it would be 72 hours [L1449, 2021-22].
  - The 3-day discount from 48 hours ends at 120 hours. The final reminder at 120 hours is described as "about 4 hours left", which implies expiry near 124 hours [L1449, 2021-22].

### Conditions and Splits

- Product range decides the 96-hour email. A broad range receives a helpful content email. A narrow range receives a discount reminder with 24 hours left [L1449, 2021-22].
- After the final reminder, the contact moves to the 30-day prospect master flow [L1449, 2021-22].

### Personalisation Fields

- Templates use these fields: {first_name}, {product_name}, {checkout_link}, {discount_code}, {expiry_date} and {business_name} [L1449, 2021-22].

#### Further details

- Abandoned checkout automation follows up with customers who initiated but didn't complete purchase, enabling recovery of otherwise lost sales through automated email sequences. [L0156, undated]

- Abandoned-cart emails run through Klaviyo's autoresponder, which automatically includes the abandoned product's information and links in the reminder emails. [L1449, 2021-22]

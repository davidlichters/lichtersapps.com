# Automation: the work loop, usage pacing, watchers, and what failed before

When to read this: before you set up any loop, schedule, background agent or "work without David" system, and before any large run that spends the Claude weekly limit.

Written 2026-11-07 from the loop designs, run logs and post-mortems on David's Mac. Three generations of loops ran between September and November 2026. All three taught something; two were switched off because they burned usage without visible results. Facts marked [MEASURED] were measured on the stated date, [GUESS] were estimates in the source. The tools named here are described in `ops/tools.md`.

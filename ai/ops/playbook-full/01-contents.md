## 1. How to read this file

- Status: version of Saturday 3 Oct 2026 16:00 (Berlin), built from six cross-checked area files (shop, Meta test campaign, creatives, offer/price/shipping, daily operations, Q4 and scaling; measurements taken 15:24 to 15:46 that day), with dated amendments up to 1 Nov 2026. It overrides every older rule we had.
- Every line names its course lesson. "Own" means our own rule, not a course rule. Abbreviations are explained in section 12. A time stamp like [07:36] is the minute in the lesson video; [PDF], [Document], [Page text] mean lesson text without a time stamp.
- Markers: [RATE] = guessed or from an unverified source. [WAHRSCHEINLICH] = probable. [SICHER] = measured. STRUCK = a rule David or Timo cancelled; it stays visible so nobody re-proposes it.
- Amendment 4 Oct 2026 12:55: B2 and B6 were aligned with D3 (video CBO 50 instead of 150 and 300 USD; start day = account day 3, per course-judge verdict 4 Oct 12:43).
- **Terms.** CPA = ad cost per purchase. ROAS = revenue divided by ad spend. CBO = campaign budget optimization (the campaign distributes its own budget). ABO = budget per ad set. Ad set = ad group. Concept = one message (for example "deadline Dec 4"). Creative = one image or one video. BOF = bottom-of-funnel ad (simple product image ad for people ready to buy). P&L = profit and loss sheet. BM = Meta Business Manager / business portfolio. "BM3" = the third business portfolio we used for Porchnap ads.
- **Course judge ("Kursrichter").** From 3 Oct 2026, any yes/no rule question went to an automated script that searched our full course transcripts and returned a verdict (KEEP / CHANGE / DROP) with lesson quotes. David (3 Oct, 21:20): "yes/no is decided by the course judge". A rule from Timo or David only entered the playbook after the course judge found a lesson for it. You can rebuild this by hand: search the transcripts for the topic, quote the lesson with minute, then decide.

## 2. Bump ladder (Timo, 4 Oct 2026 15:35, NEVER DELETE; David's additions may only be added, never replace it)

- Start a campaign at 50 or 100 USD per day.
- Raise the budget ONLY when ROAS is 2.0 or better, and ONLY at 17:00 New York time (23:00 Berlin) or 05:00 New York time (11:00 Berlin).
- Ladder from 50: 50 > 75 > 110 > 150 > 200 > 275 > 350, then +25 % per raise.
- Ladder from 100: 100 > 150 > 200 > 275 > 350, then +25 % per raise.
- The 25 % rule only applies from roughly 200 to 300 USD per day. Timo verbatim: "it only applies from about 200 to 300 budget, before that we start with 50 or 100 ... always bump only after 2 ROAS at 5 pm eastern time or 5 am eastern time".
- Course check (David's condition on 3 Oct: "check the courses first"): every step lies between +25 % (CD26 CBO [07:36]) and doubling below 500 USD (D12, CD26 Meta101 [Document]). ROAS 2.0 is stricter than our scaling threshold 1.86 (D1). The clock times appear in no course; they are Timo's practice.
- History: David said "+25 %" at 15:05, then "yes" at 15:25 to "double up to 500, every 48 h, from ROAS 2". Now the ladder applies; doubling is only the upper limit.
- If profit falls after a raise: go back one step (CD26 CBO [07:36]).

## 3. The numbers everything hangs on

- **Break-even CPA 47.01 USD (break-even ROAS 1.49)** for one bed at 69.99 USD. Derivation: 69.99 x (1 minus 5.83 % payment fee) = 65.91, minus landed cost 18.90 USD (bed size S, delivered duty paid, from supplier Bonnie) = 47.01 contribution before ads. Above a 47.01 USD CPA every sale loses money.
- **Planned CPA 33.12 USD** (not measured for this product: it is the average ad cost per order of our previous book store, 7,087.48 USD ads / 214 orders, July to September 2026; real only after 20 purchases). It leaves 13.89 USD profit per single bed.
- Honest math: 1,000 USD of ads per day gives about 30 purchases and roughly 419 USD profit per day. The goal of 200,000 USD profit (counted from 0 on 1 Oct 2026 to 31 Dec 2026, 92 selling days) needs about 2,174 USD profit per day. Only more profit per order (bundles, post-purchase upsell), budget above 1,000 USD per day, and from 12 Oct a second product close that gap (area file 06, section 1).
- Payment fee 5.83 % was measured on one Shopify Payments payout (86.42 EUR fee on 1,481.99 EUR), August 2026. It includes currency conversion because payouts went in EUR.
- Meta's "Amount spent" excludes VAT. If Meta adds 19 % VAT on a German EUR ad account and you cannot reclaim it, the real kill line is 39.50 instead of 47.01 USD. Check the Meta invoice before fixing any CPA limit (lesson 30 Sep 2026).

## 4. Part A: before the first ad dollar

**STRUCK 5 Oct 2026 08:4x.** David: "What is still stopping us from launching? ... Something is going very, very, very wrong here"; on 4 Oct 14:19: "stop holding us up". There is NO gate before launch any more. The A points are not conditions; test purchase, shop ticket, domain-registrar tasks and BM3 checks are struck. Ads may run as soon as David and Timo publish them. Course: being too slow is mistake number 1 (E1, CD26 Skalieren [01:10]). Old rule: no sales budget before A1 to A9 are green.

## 7. Sending messages to other people

**Who you may write to, without asking.**
- Strangers: suppliers, companies, anyone who answered a cold message. Since 2026-09-11 the AI sends all WhatsApps and mails to strangers itself.
- Mail to a person who has replied: run the five rounds (below), then send. Never park it as a draft (2026-09-09: one person waited 106 hours: "kann nicht sein das du für eine frage 106 stunden wartest"). A draft that lies around does not improve; it rots with its mistakes inside.

**Who you never write to.**
- Anyone David knows personally: friends, family, Timo, school, acquaintances, mentors, family friends. Draft only, and only if he asks (2026-09-11: "Niemals was an Leute schicken die ich gut kenne!"; confirmed 2026-10-30). Doubt test: did David meet this person, or did he only research them? Researched = stranger. Met = his.
- The Course D community, Whop groups, coach circles: read yes, send never without David's yes per message (2026-11-06: "Wir machen das ordentlich und in Ruhe mit Timo zusammen."). A hasty contact costs David's chance to become a coach there. In late 2026 David himself writes to the students Timo handed over; the AI prepares analysis, preview stores and drafts.
- Business customers: offers to companies (for example a B2B app client) never contain a call, video meeting, meeting or "conversation". Only email, letter, screen recording, test version. Grep every document for video, call, phone, meeting, personal before sending. Reason (2026-10-14): older, strict people; learning his age would kill the deal. Never lie on a direct question; just do not create the occasion.

**Before every send.**
1. Read the whole thread in the real inbox or chat, not your draft. (A follow-up once almost broke our own promise "this is the last mail if nothing comes".)
2. Five rounds against David's objections, improving the text each time (2026-09-08: "AB JETZT DENKST DU 5 RUNDEN NACH WAS ICH ZU DEINER NACHRICHT DIE DU VORSCHLÄGST SAGEN WÜRDE"). His recurring objections as a checklist:
   - How much do we learn from the best possible answer? A yes/no question returns one bit.
   - Does the door stay open? No "last message", no goodbye formula. A conversation ends only when the other person blocks or explicitly asks for quiet. "Viel Erfolg" from a prospect is an open door, not a rejection; answering "Danke, Ihnen auch" closed one.
   - What if my assumption is wrong? Always add an open option.
   - Why should this person answer? The reason belongs in the text.
   - Is the assumption proven? Check the history, do not guess.
   Best question format: a choice with three options plus "or something else entirely". Politeness is not a purpose; while someone answers, the goal is information.
3. The five purpose questions (2026-09-01): WHY (write the chain of next steps until money flows), READ ALOUD as the recipient, RETURN PATH (where does the answer really land), DOES IT EXIST (if they say yes now, can we deliver today), WHERE FROM (is the claim measured or only written in a file).
4. Send gate (since 2026-11-06, after a supplier message fixed USD and "PayPal is easiest" without any cost comparison): before every message to a stranger or company write a check card: purpose, the recipient's last message, every delicate sentence with its type and evidence, and a separate counter-reader agent that sees only text, chat and card and raises 5 objections. Never wave the card through yourself. New commitments on money, payment method, currency, price, deadline or access only with a comparison of two options; otherwise phrase them as a question. "Memory is not a lock": rules only in memory were skipped.
5. Language (emails to providers and companies): write in the language of the provider's last email to David; if they write in English, answer in English. On 2026-10-07 at 23:25 a goodwill email to the hosting provider Contabo went out in German, although all Contabo mail to David is English ("Dear David"). David wrote "englisch!!!!!!". The English resend at 23:27 created two tickets. Source: memory file mails-an-anbieter-englisch, 2026-10-07. A sent mail cannot be recalled; after "stop" halt immediately and say honestly what already went out.
6. WhatsApp: save every recipient number with first and last name before the first message (owner name from the company imprint). Address them by name.
7. Log what was sent.

**What a message must never contain.**
- Anything that lets a stranger infer David's age: no photo, video, selfie or face avatar (2026-09-11: "Eine Foto von mir würde close rate zerstören nicht verbessern"), no age, birth year, graduation year, school, class, exchange year, no "still in training", "next to school", "young", no links to profiles showing any of it. Trust comes from a full imprint, a phone number someone answers, verifiable real data and a cancellable price.
- Invented claims about David's own business, family or profession (an outreach generator once invented "I'm building my own firm" and "raising young kids").
- A free public source presented as what we sell (2026-09-12: "Hört sich an als würd euch etwas das gratis ist teuer weiter verkaufen"). Name the work first, then the source, then the price.
- A true sentence that makes us unnecessary ("a true sentence can kill the sale", 2026-09-11, source: memory note wahrer-satz-kann-verkaufen-toeten). Every sentence of a sales text must pass two questions: 1) does it do its own job (proof, clarity, trust)? 2) what does it do to the page's other goals, above all: if the reader believes it, do they still need us? On 2026-09-11 the landing page said, right above our Bundesanzeiger proof, that every name could be looked up in the Bundesanzeiger in two minutes; true and trust-building, but two sections up stood the 79 EUR/month price, so whoever believed it paid nothing. David found it, no tool did (checkers look for errors, this sentence had none). A true concession stays, but with its boundary in the same paragraph (the replacement said: a name you already have you can find there without us; the job is knowing in advance which of your customers appears on which of the 365 days; looking up backwards versus watching forwards). Enforced by `node werkzeug/selbstschuss.mjs seite/index.html` in the Stop hook (see ops/tools, "Selbstschuss").
- A promise you cannot fulfil today: check the segment exists, the filter the recipient should name exists, and the quantity makes a delivery that is not embarrassing.
- The internal project name of a product where the public name differs (for the insolvency radar: only "Liquidationsradar" outside, grep for the internal name = 0 before publishing).
- Signs of AI writing (2026-08-24, all five drafts "sounded like AI"): zero contractions ("I am", "do not" instead of "I'm", "don't") is the strongest single signal; mirroring the recipient's answer back as a neat summary; little maxims ("Budget first, then physics."); meta comments about one's own honesty; length (90 words for a question that needed a time; 29 were right). Count contractions before showing any English draft.

**Channel rules.**
- When a person names a channel (phone number, time), answer in exactly that channel. A prospect who sent his phone number and asked for a call got two long emails.
- Suppliers: every supplier message gets an answer in the same turn, at least thanks plus what is still missing, through the send gate. Reading and evaluating does not count as answering (2026-11-07: "Du hast schon wieder nicht auf whatsapp geantwortet").
- A watcher reads David's WhatsApp chat list every 20 seconds while a supplier chat is open and wakes the AI on any new message not from us; restart it after every wake.
- Before reporting "no reply", compare the preview text and time in the chat list with the last message you read; the chat reader can show an old history (2026-11-03: two supplier messages were missed this way).
- Chinese suppliers cannot open AliExpress or TikTok Shop links. Always send an image. Sending images through WhatsApp Web hangs while the tab is hidden; either bring the tab to the front (allowed since 2026-11-02) or send a link to a page with an og:image preview (1200x630), whose picture travels inside the message.
- Book suppliers: the AI asks in writing about stock, price and delivery time only; David then asks about rights by phone, only for titles in stock. Never ask a supplier about rights a second time, not even rephrased: they get fed up (2026-11-06/07).
- Product questions (size, fabric, shipping days) the AI may ask itself.

**Morning drafts (older rule, 2026-08-24).** When David says he is back after being away, show every unsent draft that needs his approval in full and wait for "send". Do not summarise or link. Still valid for messages to people he knows.

---

**David's own numbers in any guide, website text or pitch (David, 2026-10-17).** Use only the values he corrected on 2026-10-17: 50 sales calls (not 80), one client agreed to 500 USD with installments and paid 150 EUR, ALL coaching client results were faked, TikTok 12 million views = 25 EUR from one low-ticket sale, Instagram 1 million views = 150 EUR from part of one sale (more effort), design skills and starting capital never there, the over 1,000 USD in outbound were debt, not savings. Never tell any of it as a solved problem. Never write "mowing lawns instead of online" (demotivating); say instead about 1 hour a day of simple paid work on the side. Full list: https://lichtersapps.com/ai/david.md section "David's real numbers and how they may be used".

## 8. Messages to David on WhatsApp

- At most 2 to 3 short lines, action first, no paths. "Ich lese nichts, was mehr als drei bis vier Zeilen lang ist ... Schreib mir, als waer ich Milliardaer, der keine Zeit fuer dich hat." (2026-10-03, after reminders of about 900 characters.) Automated reminders are cut to "In N min: <text>" with at most 110 characters.
- Send only when it changes what he does in the next hour: money running away, something harmful happening (messages going to wrong people, someone being spammed), a result that changes the plan, a blocker only he can clear, and real measured good news (asked for on 2026-08-19: "A measured saving, a fix that lands, a first reply"). Never routine status, never "still running". Roughly at most one message an hour unless urgent.
- Never anything that would embarrass him if read over his shoulder; never credentials or customer data.
- Phone calls (the alarm level that rings) only for a human reply that needs him or a new paying customer.

## 9. Money

**David's money is real (2026-08-20, restated 2026-11-02).** In August 2026 he was 3,000 USD down, funded by a farm job: "im a kid. i cant go thousands into debt. i would take months of hard work after school to pay that back." His absolute borrowing ceiling was about 10,000 USD, the point where the business dies. On 2026-11-02 the AI planned 20 USD/day ads and asked "200 USD yes or no" without asking about his money: "Ich habe gar keine 200 USD. Ich habe 10 USD in meinem Account."

Rules:
1. Before any budget or campaign plan, ask or look up how much money David actually has right now and where it comes from. A plan that needs more than exists starts with the money source, not the campaign. (Minimum Curlmoon test: 60 USD, 3 days at 20 USD.)
2. Never quote a cost that did not come from the provider's billing console or a real invoice. Our own run logs undercounted by 7.4x (killed rounds write nothing, call counters miss about half the calls).
3. State the running cost BEFORE starting anything that spends. Multi-agent workflows and long autonomous runs cost real money; say so first.
4. Any cap change is a money decision: compute cap times verified cost per unit, say the number, get his yes. Never infer approval from enthusiasm.
5. If value per unit is below cost per unit, say so in the same breath as any proposal to do more. Say plainly when a channel loses money even if he wants to continue; he can overrule what he sees, not what is hidden.
6. A per-run cap is not a daily cap: four runs at 5 EUR are 20.
- Older rule (2026-09-08): within an approved daily allowance (then 20 EUR/day) the AI MUST decide small spends itself and never ask about 3 USD. Still valid in spirit: small approved amounts are not his problem. But the allowance is only real if the money exists (rule 1).

**Anthropic billing facts (measured August 2026).** API credits were on auto-reload: an empty balance does not stop anything, the card is charged automatically (20 charges, 407 USD in four days once). Every Anthropic charge carries 19 % German VAT that the console does not show, so console figures are 19 % low as card charges. The subscription (Max 20x, 180 EUR/month) is billed separately from API credits. Never estimate totals from the number of receipts. Never touch payment settings; David switches auto-reload off himself.

**Before every purchase, compare prices (2026-08-18).** Never recommend the vendor where he already has an account because it is convenient (a convenience recommendation almost cost about 100 EUR on 10 domains). Check several vendors, intro prices, promotions, monthly vs yearly, show them side by side. A price you did not read on the vendor's own page cannot carry a recommendation (2026-09-24). Also: when David asks about one specific way, check whether a simpler or cheaper way to the same goal exists and say it first in one sentence ("works, but X is easier because Y"). Before installing anything, check price and whether it needs a paid account (a remote-desktop server install turned out to need a paid license, David: "Müll, kostet Geld").

**Domains.**
- David gets any domain for 0.84 EUR in the first year (2026-11-02): checkdomain charges 0.07 EUR/month for the first 12 months to new customers, for .com and .de; he opens a new customer account per purchase with a Gmail plus-alias. After that .com costs 2.39 EUR/month (28.68/year), .de 1.49 EUR/month; minimum term 12 months, 14 days notice. Domain price is never a criterion when choosing names; only check that the .com is free (RDAP lookup). Very short names like david.com are out.
- Before a domain purchase, write the exact name as a copy block in chat and check the cart against it before paying (2026-11-02 a typo domain was bought).
- Cancel every shop domain right after purchase, effective at the end of the term (2026-11-02: "Wir brauchen die shops eh immer nur ein jahr und falls mal laenger lieber einmal log in daten suchen als jede domain ausversehen zu lang haben"). At checkdomain: domain details, tile "Kündigung", type a reason, "Weiter" (measured: "Weiter" already triggers the cancellation and the confirmation mail arrives immediately; read it back for the end date). Undo: same page, "Kündigung stornieren". Record which domain sits on which account and email in an accounts list (never passwords). Add a reminder three weeks before expiry in case the shop still runs. Exceptions, never cancel: the mail domain used for all shop addresses and logins, and the apps website domain that hosts the privacy pages Apple requires. Course backing: trend products usually run 2 to 4, rarely 4 to 5 months; if a shop becomes a brand with steady profit, undo the cancellation because the domain belongs to the shop in a sale.
- Shop email: one address per shop on our own forwarding domain ([shopname]@ our mail domain, catch-all forward), never buy a mail package. A forwarding domain cannot send mail; every real sending path costs money (measured 2026-09-10).

**Reporting a cancellation:** say "cancelled" only together with the contract end date and any open ticket. Answer every provider reply the same day. (2026-10: cancelled servers kept billing for two months because the support's one request was never answered.)

**Paid tools (2026-09-29).** "Wir haben für alle bezahlt, also brauchen wir gute Gründe, nicht alle zu nutzen. Und jedes, das wir nutzen, nutzen wir extrem." No artificial usage caps on paid research tools ("komplett bescheuert"). Shared tool accounts: never change shared profile settings (another user's currency setting changes for everyone).

## 10. AI usage, limits and research

The stance changed several times; the current state is at the top.

**Current (since 2026-11-06).**
- Usage only against visible results: "Verbrauch ist kein Fortschritt. Ein Bericht über Arbeit ist kein Ergebnis." On another account a whole 200 USD plan was gone in 30 days and the run had produced nothing. Before every workflow say which result will be visible at the end (page, file, image, build). Afterwards report what was created, what it consumed, and say openly when the result is zero. No endless loops without end date and abort condition. Research agents stay off until David says otherwise.
- Even pace: 10 to 14 % of the weekly limit per day; unused share may roll to the next day ("wenn tag 1 nur 10% war geht an tag zwei auch 18%"). The week runs Thursday 12:00 to Thursday 12:00 Berlin time. Target by day n: at most 14.3 % x n, at least 10 % x n. Check usage before every big run. Under target: add work from the build list, only work with a visible result. Over target: no agent fleets, small work. **Since 2026-11-07 19:30/19:50 two accounts:** Ultra (reset Thursday 12:00, 1.7x Max's weekly amount) and Max (reset Saturday 12:00, 37 % of the total); Max is drained Wednesday about 21:50 to Saturday 12:00, Ultra runs Saturday 12:00 to Wednesday 21:50; every loop round checks which plan is active. Details: https://lichtersapps.com/ai/ops/automation/01-contents.md section 3.
- Never save on store building: a store costs about 3 % of the weekly limit, which David values at about 0.50 EUR per percent, so practically nothing (2026-11-07). Faster only through parallelism.
- Model and context: Opus stays, context compaction at 500k tokens is the default for all chats (2026-11-05). Measured: 69 % of load is re-reading long chats, output plus thinking only 8 %; at 200k a long chat compacted every 7 minutes, 41 minutes of standstill in one afternoon. David rejected Sonnet helpers and compaction at 300k: "würde doch weniger sparen weil wir alles 5 mal machen müssen". Do not propose again; save only without quality loss. At every big task boundary start a new chat with a written handover.
- 2026-11-03 at 97 % weekly usage ("die letzten 3 % müssen 2 Tage halten"): agent fleets (one ad helper carried 32 MB of images in context) were stopped, hourly background jobs paused.
- Event-driven work (2026-11-06): no timer that wakes the AI for empty rounds; the next round starts only after a finished helper. Every timed loop so far was less productive than manual prompting. (Older, replaced on 2026-11-07 17:15 by the permanent 30-minute loop, because David no longer wanted to write every prompt himself: section 10 in https://lichtersapps.com/ai/ops/automation/02-6-generation-2-the-5-minute-takt-for-porchnap-sept.md .)

**Plan capacity facts.** For weekly usage, Max 20x is about 6x Pro and Max 5x about 3.5x Pro (weekly Sonnet hours: Pro 40 to 80, Max 5x 140 to 280, Max 20x 240 to 480). "20x" only describes the 5-hour window. Never calculate with 20x (David corrected this 2026-09-19).

**Superseded stances (for context).** 2026-09-19 at 92 % weekly limit everything consuming was paused. 2026-09-29: "Wochenlimit ist uns komplett egal, wenn wir mehr brauchen, kaufen wir Enterprise". 2026-10-14 the 5-minute background takt and the idea finder were switched off because they burned usage on all accounts and produced unused ideas; on again only on David's word.

**Research goes to Perplexity (global rule, 2026-10-03).** "Alles, was auch nur ansatzweise mit Perplexity gemacht werden kann, muss mit Perplexity gemacht werden." Any question answerable without our files (market, prices, platform rules, competitors, tools, taxes, deadlines) goes to Perplexity, never to research agents and never to your own knowledge as a substitute. Web search inside the AI is blocked on purpose. Own pages are still measured with curl. Since 2026-09-29 any question may be concrete, including our store, suppliers, prices and names ("Die Chats sind eh alle inkognito"). Every question asks for three levels plus a takeover note; read levels 1 and 2. Default model was GPT-6 Sol (it found a current pet statistic that Deep Research with another model missed); use a second model as counter-check on important numbers. Never re-research what the lawyer or psychologist explained to David (2026-11-06).

**How the Perplexity pipeline worked (for rebuilding).** A script drove a shared Perplexity Max account inside an anti-detect browser profile via AppleScript `execute javascript` (the debug port did not listen). Gotchas: always incognito; "submit clicked" is not proof, check that a thread URL `/search/<id>` exists (four questions once stayed in the field); synthetic Enter in the input field sends immediately; up to 20 parallel runs, each in its own tab and closing it, staggered 3 s, only one run may log in at a time; the tool-suite extension's license window appears when 12 to 15 tabs open within 20 seconds; never remove a "license needed" flag to test, read the open tab's text instead.

**Course knowledge before asking anyone.** All bought courses were merged by topic (about 1,568 lessons by 2026-09-29, nothing shortened, the course named only at the bottom of each lesson). When a task matches a purpose in the course prompt index (returns, shipping, about us, product description, domain, niche, SEO, CSV), use the course prompt verbatim, fill placeholders, name the source; never invent your own (2026-09-29). Answers slip when paraphrasing (adding "only", dropping "probably" or conditions): quote, do not paraphrase.

**Course library inventory (moved here from ops/gaps-2-1.md on 2026-11-07; the 1,568 above is the older count).** All courses David bought, transcribed verbatim and merged by topic into one library (nothing shortened; course name only in the last line of each lesson). Totals: 1,523 lesson files, 547 hours of video, plus page texts, PDFs and documents (index header, 2026-11); an earlier count on 2026-09-29 said 1,568 lessons.

| Course | Teacher | Size | Years | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Course D 2026 | Course D team | 100 lessons with PDFs and linked docs | 2026 | product research, Meta ads, Kalodata, BOF, scaling; lesson 090 names the private China agents |
| Course B | Course B | 314 videos (290 lesson files) | 2021 to 2022 | high-ticket dropshipping, Google Ads and Shopping, SEO, CRO, email, retargeting; US suppliers |
| Course E 2026 | Course E | 103 of 227 videos (only 103 were ever downloaded), about 23 h | 2026 | Shopify brands, offers, Meta ads, email, apps, AI playbooks |
| Course A | Course A | 406 videos plus 346 documents (PDFs, prompts; 344 built in) | 2020 to 2026 | niche choice, US brand suppliers, store, Google and Meta, coaching calls; page templates (About, Shipping, Refund) |
| Course C | Course C | 210 videos (230 lesson files) plus 98 documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX; 6 image-only) | recent | beginner path, CJ Dropshipping and HyperSKU recommendation |

Gotchas: speech recognition misspelled names and tools and was never corrected (search variants: Klaviyo/clavio, Kalodata/calo data, ROAS/RAS). Recording years matter: 2021-22 lessons show outdated platform screens. If a Course E lesson refers to a missing video, say it is missing. Course prompts are used verbatim when one fits the task. Since 2026-11-07 frequently used steps become fixed procedures; /ecom is the human-readable book, /ai the AI page.
